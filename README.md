# Java Challenge Breakdown
## Reverse an Array

### Challenge
Reverse an array without using any built in methods.

### Approach & Efficiency
Kevin and I chose to reverse the array in place by swapping elements. We chose this approach because the space complexity was less (we think) than creating a new array.
* time complexity = O(n)
* space complexity = O(1)?
